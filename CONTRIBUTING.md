Adding new algorithms is always appreciated by us.

Feel free to add any unique algorithm that you may find or have used or you think may be useful. Just fork this repository, add the algorithm with suitable name and `.java` extension file. Create a pull request, and that's it.

We'll take care of the rest :)
